# 🚧 U.S. Road Accident Analysis using Visual Analytics

This project investigates road accident patterns across the United States by leveraging the large-scale **U.S. Accidents** dataset. Using advanced visualizations and data exploration techniques, we analyze the impact of environmental conditions, geography, infrastructure, and time on accident severity and frequency.

The goal is to help city planners, traffic management agencies, and public safety officials better understand accident triggers and develop localized safety interventions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify accident hotspots at both national and city levels
- Understand correlations between accident severity and weather, road features, and time of day
- Propose actionable insights for improving emergency response and road infrastructure
- Create interactive and accessible visualizations to support data-driven policy-making

## 📊 Key Visualizations & Insights

- **Accident Severity vs Weather**  
  Stacked bar charts and violin plots showed that accidents in conditions like *scattered clouds* and *overcast* had higher severity than "clear" or "fair" weather.

- **Geospatial Analysis**  
  Heatmaps and interactive maps revealed dense clusters of accidents in cities like Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, highlighting urban congestion and infrastructure strain.

- **Temporal Trends**  
  - Morning (7–9 AM) and evening (4–6 PM) rush hours had the highest accident counts  
  - Winter months showed higher accident rates, especially in icy regions  
  - Fridays recorded the most weekday accidents

- **Infrastructure Risk Zones**  
  - Features like *traffic signals*, *junctions*, and *crossings* were linked to both high frequency and high severity  
  - Roundabouts and turning loops had fewer severe incidents, indicating safer traffic design

- **Accident Survivability & Amenities**  
  Cities like Atlanta with fewer nearby amenities and longer accident durations had more non-survivable cases, highlighting emergency response gaps.

- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  Word clouds and histograms of accident descriptions revealed a slight skew toward negative sentiment and common terms like “caution,” “exit,” and “northbound”.
